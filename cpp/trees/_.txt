###
Tree - is a non-linear data-structure that simulates a hiarchial tree structure with a root value & subtrees of children with parent node, represent as set of linked nodes.

> Terminology :
Root - root is a special node in a tree. The entire tree is referenced through it. It doesnt have any parent.
Parent Node - is a Immediate predecessor of a node.
Child Node - All Immediate successor of a node are its children.
Siblings - Nodes with the same parent are called siblings.
Leaf - Last node of a tree.
Edge - The connection between two nodes or a node and a leaf.
Path - path is a nmber of successor edges from source node to destination node.
Degree of Node - Degree of a node is equal to number of children. Also the maximum number of children also called degree of a node.

Depth of Node - represents the number of edges from the tree's root node to the perticular node.
Height of Node - is the number of edges on the longest path between node and leaf.
Height of tree - is the height of its root node.

In a valid N nodes we have N-1 nodes.


### Binary Tree :
1. A binary tree is called strict/proper binary tree, when each node has 2 or 0 children;
2. A binary tree is called Complete binary tree if all levels except the last are 
completely filled or all nodes are as left as possible.
3. A binary tree is called Perfect binary tree if all levels are completely filled with 2
children is.
4. Max number of nodes at level "x" = 2^x
5. For a binary tree , maximum number of nodes with height "h" = 2^0 + 2^1 +...+ 2^h = 2^(h+1) -1 
6. A binary tree is called Balanced binary tree, if the difference between the height of left and right subtree for every node is not more than k (usally 1).

### Binary search tree :
BST is a binary tree data structure, in which the values in the left subtree of every node are 
smaller and the values in the right subtrees of every node are larger.

The searching mechanism in binary search tree, is much more efficient than normal binary tree.

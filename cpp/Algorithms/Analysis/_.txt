###
Algorithm Analysis - is a study to provides theoretical estimation for the required resources of an algorithm to solve a specific computation problem i.e. calculating efficiency.

Generally , the efficiency an algorith is related to the input length (number of steps), known as TIME complexity, volume of memory, known as SPACE complexity.


###
Asymptotic Algorithm Analysis - is a method of defining the mathematical of its run-time performance.

using the Asymptotic Analysis , we can easily estimate about the estimate casescenario of an algorithm. In simple words, it is used to mathematically calculate the running time of any operation inside an algorithm.

Asymptotic Analysis is used to estimate the time-complexity function for an arbitrarily large input.


###
Time Complexity: is a computational way to show how(behavior) runtime of a program changes as the size of the input changes.

###
The Big O Notation is the formal / mathematical way to express the upper bound (worst case) of an algorithm's run-time.

The simple steps are to find the Big O Notation easily: 
1  Find the fasted growing variable term.
2  Eliminate the co-efficients / constant terms.



*** Note: Algorithm Analysis does not give you acurate / exact values (time ,space etc), however it gives estimates which can be used to study the behavior of the algorith.
